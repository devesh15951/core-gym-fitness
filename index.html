    	<h1>Alright, Let's Address This</h1>
        <p>Media can be anything ranging from television, radio, movies, newspapers, &amp; more. We basically experience media on a daily basis. For instance, we'll be driving in our car and we'll see a bill board for a car repair shop. We'll be in the grocery line and see magazines about Kim Kardashian and her new baby. Media is in our everyday lives and we really can't avoid it.</p>
        <p>In fact, media is so integrated into our daily lives that we don't even realize the effect that it sometimes has on us. It influences us in such a sneaky way. Media affects the way we dress, the way we socialize, and even the way we perceive men and women. In fact, many people have called out the media for representing women in a negative light. </p>
        <p>There's this lack of feminism in media that still needs to be addressed. When mentioning feminism, burning bras or overpowering men is not the intention. There seems to be a great misunderstanding when the term feminism is mentioned. Feminism is defined as <q>the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes</q> <cite>Merriam-Webster.</cite> </p>
        <p>Media is very much male dominated. Of course, there have been strides towards reaching a more inclusive and diverse media industry. For instance, both girls and boys and included in toy truck commercials. These advances are amazing but there is still a very long way to go with media. The more that it shows sexist ads, the more we are programmed to think that way. For instance, skinny models are shown on televison and a lot of people see that everyday. Soon enough, they start to think that being skinny is the beauty standard.</p>
